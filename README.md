# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
  Using HTML we were able to build a strong and manageable foundation for organizing the code. 
- Flexbox
  Flexbox help us be "flexible" with the way we position different elements throughout the page to make it easier for the viewer to understand.
- Positioning
  Positioning allows us to organize the page the way we want without having to rely on the default positioning. We can make our page unique and interesting for different viewers. 
- Flat BEM file structure
  Flat BEM file structure helps us organize the CSS code in different files by their blocks. This allows the programmer to be able to easily find different areas of the project and eliminates the possibility of spending unnesscary amounts of time looking for specific code.
- A custom form
  These forms allows us to input and send different data into our server from a specific audience. We get to ulitize different things such as buttons, toggle switches, checkboxes, drop-down-lists, text-input fields, and many more. In our case for this website, it allows our customers to book a table digitally and we can look through the data online.
- CSS animation and transform
  CSS animation and transform aren't super necessary, but they help make our form look cool and attractive towards different customers. Instead of a plain boring site, we add a little be of animation to let our customer remember our form. It also helps the customers understand which things are links or things you can click on in general as well. It takes different images and words and make them change shape/color/size for different purposes.

## Plan on improving the project
Instead of having only one section for the menu, I would make different menu sections, like one for drinks, one more food, and one for baked goods. Along with that, I would add a image for each thing on the menu so the customers can understand what a specific food/drink looks like so they aren't confused. Sometimes customers may not know what a specific food or drink looks like, so they may need a image to clear their doubts. I would add more animations for the last 2 section, because personally they look a little dull even though they a single animation near the title.

Add your ideas here :)
